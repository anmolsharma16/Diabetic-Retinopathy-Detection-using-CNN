# Diabetic-Retinopathy-Detection-using-CNN

Diabetic retinopathy, also known as diabetic eye disease (DED), is a medical condition in which damage occurs to the retina due to diabetes mellitus. It is a leading cause of blindness in many countries.
Diabetic retinopathy affects up to 80 percent of those who have had diabetes for 20 years or more. At least 90% of new cases could be reduced with proper treatment and monitoring of the eyes. The longer a person has diabetes, the higher his or her chances of developing diabetic retinopathy.

Our main aim in this project is Early Detection of Stages in Diabetic Retinopathy using Convolutional Neural Networks. For this, we develop a five-stage classifier for detecting Diabetic Retinopathy using DenseNet121, ResNet50, and InceptionV3 architectures.We use Data Augmentation and Image pre-processing for better results.Final Accuracy obtained : DenseNet121: 96.64%, ResNet50: 95.71%, InceptionV3: 94.73%
